## Content management

### Managing tabbed content
To disable tabbed content and show only first generation content:

1. Open `/themes/canbreach-theme/layout/_partial/tabbed-content.ejs`
2. Set the configuration variable at the top:
```javascript
<%
// Set this to true to show only first generation content
const showOnlyFirstGen = true;
%>
```

### Adding team members
1. Create a new page in `source/team/[name].md`
2. Include required front matter:
```
---
title: [Full Name]
date: [Date]
menu_item: true
menu_order: [number]
layout: author
photo: [path-to-photo]
---
```
3. Add the team member name to the author linking system in `/themes/canbreach-theme/scripts/publications.js`:
```
const authorsWithLinks = [
  "Negar Ghahramani",
  "Daniel Adria",
  "Nahyan Rana",
  "New Team Member Name"  // Add the name here
];
```
This step is necessary for creating automatic links from publications to author profiles.

### Removing team members spot

1. Hide/Show Members Navigation:
   ```yaml
   # In members/index.md front matter
   ---
   title: Members
   menu_order: 3
   menu_item: false  # Add to hide, remove to show
   ---
   ```

2. Remove/Restore Member Profile Links:
   ```javascript
   // In publications.js
   const authorsWithLinks = [];  // Empty array to remove links
   
   // Restore with original array when needed:
   const authorsWithLinks = [
     "Negar Ghahramani",
     "Daniel Adria",
     "Nahyan Rana"
   ];
   ```

### Managing publications
1. Edit `source/_data/publications.yml`
2. Publications are organized by type with required fields:
```yaml
- type: [Publication Type]
  title: [Title]
  authors: [Author Array]
  year: [Year]
  doi: [DOI link] # optional
  # Additional fields based on type:
  journal: [Journal Name] # for articles
  conference: [Conference Name] # for conference papers
  subtype: [Thesis Type] # for theses
  repository: [Repository Name] # for databases
```

### Publication dates
The `month` field in `publications.yml` refers to the issue date, not the publication date. For example:
- For a journal article published online in January but issued in the March edition, use `month: March`
- For conference papers, use the month when the conference was held
- For theses, use the month of graduation/defense

[This image](https://i.imgur.com/Za4J62t.png) provides some explanation.

### Creating pages
1. Add new pages in `source/`
2. Include menu metadata for navigation:
```yaml
---
title: [Page title]
menu_item: true
menu_order: [number]
---
```

### Supporting generational content
Pages can include both first and second generation content using the front matter:
```
---
first_generation: |
  [First generation content]
second_generation: |
  [Second generation content]
---
```
